    In several buildings in Turin, LinkSmart® helped to improve energy management
    and control in existing (even historical) buildings by introducing IoT sensors
    with minimum refurbishment interventions. Energy savings from 27% to 36% have
    been achieved in the winter period and from 63% to 74% for cooling energy in
    summer period.

    In Turin, a LinkSmart®-enabled IoT infrastructure was deployed to test the future of
    waste management. LinkSmart® stream mining and learning services were used to monitor
    and predict the fill levels of waste containers in order to optimize the waste management
    processes of the city.
