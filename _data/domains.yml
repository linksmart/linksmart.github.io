    In several buildings in Turin, LinkSmart® helped to improve energy management 
    and control in existing (even historical) buildings by introducing IoT sensors 
    with minimum refurbishment interventions. Energy savings from 27% to 36% have 
    been achieved in the winter period and from 63% to 74% for cooling energy in 
    summer period.

    Deep in the rain forest, LinkSmart® was used to implement interactive 
    energy awareness applications for visitors of Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil.

    In factories in Ireland and Greece, LinkSmart® infrastructure is used to digitize 
    the production processes. In particular, LinkSmart® IoT Agents apply stream mining 
    to enable predictive maintenance for the production lines.

    In Turin, a LinkSmart®-enabled IoT infrastructure was deployed to test the future of 
    waste management. LinkSmart® stream mining and learning services were used to monitor 
    and predict the fill levels of waste containers in order to optimize the waste management 
    processes of the city.

    IOn the island of Fur in the north of Denmark, LinkSmart® helped for the first time ever 
    to measure and balance load in the low-voltage grid and thereby prevent or reduce critical 
    peak situations.

    Households in Germany and Slovenia are testing LinkSmart® IoT Gateways as part of an 
    energy monitoring and control system. The pilot project targets end users and future 
    scenarios of flexible energy generation and consumption.
